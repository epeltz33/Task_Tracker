## Command Reference

| Command | Description | Format |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `add` | Create a new task | `add "Task title"` |
| `update` | Update an existing task | `update <id> "New title"` |
| `delete` | Remove a task | `delete <id>` |
| `progress` | Mark task as in progress | `progress <id>` |
| `done` | Mark task as completed | `done <id>` |
| `list` | Show all tasks | `list [--all/--done/--todo/--progress]` |

## Sample Output

When listing tasks, you'll see output similar to:

```
ID | Status | Title
--------------------------------------------------
1 | todo | Write documentation
2 | in progress | Implement error handling
3 | done | Create basic structure
```

## Data Storage

All tasks are stored in a `tasks.json` file in the same directory as the script. Each task contains:

- Unique ID
- Title
- Status (todo, in_progress, done)
- Creation timestamp
- Last update timestamp

Example structure:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Complete project proposal",
    "status": "done",
    "created_at": "2025-02-25T15:30:45.123456",
    "updated_at": "2025-02-25T16:45:12.654321"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:
- File I/O operations
- Invalid task IDs
- Empty task titles
- Corrupted JSON data
- Excessive title length

## Extending the Application

This task tracker is designed to be simple but extensible. Some ideas for expansion:
- Add due dates
- Task priorities
- Task categories/tags
- Data export functionality
- Interactive mode
